## Abstract

We present SpectralAI, a system that replaces the O(N^2) matrix multiplication in transformer attention mechanisms with O(N log N) Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) traversal accelerated by dedicated ray tracing hardware (NVIDIA RT Cores). Our approach makes three contributions: (1) *RT Attention* -- a method that projects token embeddings into 3D geometric space and uses hardware-accelerated BVH traversal for expert routing in Mixture-of-Experts models, achieving 112--218x routing speedup over PyTorch baselines and 731x VRAM reduction; (2) *Inception Engine* -- a nested Instance Acceleration Structure (IAS) architecture that composes four levels of 3D spaces into an effective 12-dimensional semantic representation, bypassing the hardware's native 3D limitation (PPL within 1.8% of GPT-2 baseline); and (3) *Spectral Routing* -- a context-dependent routing mechanism inspired by optical refraction (Snell's law), where semantic nodes act as prisms with learned refractive indices, resolving token polysemy with 98.4% accuracy (80 polysemous words, 442 context pairs) at less than 0.12% computational overhead. We validate our system on OLMoE-1B-7B (7B parameters, 64 experts, 16 MoE layers) using an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti.

## Three Innovations

1. **RT Core Attention (Patent JS-2026-001):** BVH traversal replaces dense MatMul. O(log N) instead of O(N^2). OptiX 9.0 Cooperative Vectors enable in-shader calibration via Tensor Cores.

2. **Inception Engine (Patent JS-2026-002):** 4 nested IAS levels encode 12 semantic dimensions using only 3D hardware. Each level is a "dimensional portal" that resets coordinates. Capacity: ~1 billion semantic entities.

3. **Spectral Routing (Patent JS-2026-003):** Rays carry a "color" (context vector). Nodes act as prisms (Snell's law) -- the same node routes differently based on context, resolving polysemy without duplicating parameters.
