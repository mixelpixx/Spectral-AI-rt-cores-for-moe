## Overview

This document summarizes three provisional patent applications covering the SpectralAI system -- a novel approach to neural network attention and expert routing using hardware-accelerated ray tracing (RT Cores) instead of matrix multiplication.

All claims are backed by empirical measurements on an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti using the OLMoE-1B-7B model (7B parameters, 64 experts, 16 MoE layers).

## Patent JS-2026-001: System and Method for Attention Mechanism Using Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing with BVH Traversal

**Core Innovation:** Replacing the O(N^2) matrix multiplication in transformer attention with O(N log N) BVH traversal on dedicated RT Core hardware.

**Key Claims Validated:**
- Token-to-geometry mapping: D-dimensional embeddings projected to 3D positions preserving cosine similarity
- Hierarchical BVH Router: 3 levels, branching factor 4, covering 64 experts
- BVH routing accuracy: 89.3--97.6% top-8 per layer (mean 95.9% across 16 layers)
- RT Core latency: **19.1 us/batch** (triangle async), **13.4M queries/s**, **100% accuracy**
- Routing speedup: **112--218x** vs PyTorch linear gate (batch-dependent)
- VRAM reduction: **731x** (4.03 MB active vs 2,944 MB dense baseline)
- Confidence-gated routing: Adaptive per-token BVH/gate selection based on logit confidence
- Perplexity: pre-filter 48 candidates = PPL 6.79 (+1.5%); hybrid mode = PPL 7.17 (+0.4%)
- HellaSwag downstream: baseline 53.1%, 3-layer 52.2%, 16-layer 52.0% (N=2,000)

**34 claims** (10 independent), covering hardware acceleration, software-only fallback, confidence-gated routing, and computer-readable medium.

## Patent JS-2026-002: System and Method for Multi-Dimensional Semantic Representation Using Nested Instance Acceleration Structures

**Core Innovation:** Composing 4 levels of 3D Instance Acceleration Structures (IAS) to achieve an effective 12-dimensional semantic space using only 3D RT Core hardware.

**Key Claims Validated:**
- Inception Engine architecture: 4-level nested IAS with "dimensional portals" (3x4 affine transforms)
- Effective dimensionality: 4 levels x 3D = 12 semantic dimensions
- Hierarchy capacity: up to ~1 billion semantic entities (64 x 64 x 256 x 1,024)
- Traversal complexity: O(L * log_b(N)) = O(4 * 15) = 60 node visits
- Fourier resonance at leaf level: learnable spectral signatures per semantic entity
- Prototype validation: PPL 185.4 (within 1.8% of GPT-2 baseline 182.2) with 16.5M parameters

**30 claims** (11 independent), covering hierarchical traversal, dimensional portals, Fourier resonance, and software-only implementations.

## Patent JS-2026-003: System and Method for Context-Dependent Routing Using Spectral Encoding and Optical Refraction Principles

**Core Innovation:** Using optical refraction (Snell's law) for context-dependent token routing, where rays carry a "spectral color" encoding conversational context, and semantic nodes act as prisms with learned refractive indices.

**Key Claims Validated:**
- Spectral context encoding: color vector f in R^k (k=256) from conversational context
- Prismatic sphere nodes: context-dependent refractive index n = n_base + sigma(W_dispersion * f)
- Snell's law routing: refraction angle determines expert selection
- Total Internal Reflection (TIR): domain boundaries prevent misrouting
- Chromatic aberration: multi-band decomposition (B=4 bands) for improved disambiguation
- Polysemy resolution: **98.4%** accuracy (80 polysemous words, 442 context pairs)
- Computational overhead: < 0.12% (chromatic), < 0.04% (single-band)

**44 claims** (14 independent), covering context-dependent routing, multi-band decomposition, TIR, phase coherence, and training loss.
