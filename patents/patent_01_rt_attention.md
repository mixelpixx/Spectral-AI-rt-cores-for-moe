## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to the field of artificial intelligence and large language model (LLM) inference. More specifically, the invention relates to a novel attention mechanism for neural language models that replaces conventional matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations with hardware-accelerated ray tracing operations using Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) data structures and dedicated ray tracing (RT) processing cores available in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), thereby achieving O(N log N) computational complexity instead of the conventional O(N^2) complexity.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Prior Art and Limitations

Large language models based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across natural language processing tasks. The core of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which computes pairwise relationships between all tokens in a sequence using scaled dot-product attention:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q * K^T / sqrt(d_k)) * V
```

where Q (query), K (key), and V (value) are matrices derived from the input sequence of N tokens, and d_k is the key dimension. This operation requires computation of the full N x N attention matrix, resulting in O(N^2) time and memory complexity.

**Limitations of the Prior Art:**

1. **Quadratic Scaling:** For a sequence of N = 100,000 tokens, the attention matrix contains 10^10 (ten billion) entries. Computing this matrix requires approximately 80 trillion floating-point operations (FLOPs) per attention layer. This quadratic cost is the primary bottleneck limiting context window sizes in current LLMs.

2. **Memory Consumption:** The Key-Value (KV) cache mechanism used during autoregressive inference stores key and value projections across all layers. For a model with 96 layers and 4096-dimensional hidden states, the KV cache for 100,000 tokens consumes approximately 307 GB of VRAM, exceeding the memory capacity of any single commercial GPU.

3. **Hardware Requirements:** Serving models like GPT-4 or Gemini requires clusters of NVIDIA H100 GPUs (approximately 30,000 EUR per unit) operating in parallel via NVLink or InfiniBand interconnects. This restricts deployment to well-funded organizations with access to datacenter-grade hardware.

4. **Underutilized Silicon:** Modern consumer GPUs (NVIDIA RTX 4090, RTX 5070 Ti) contain dedicated Ray Tracing (RT) Cores designed for Bounding Volume Hierarchy traversal and ray-geometry intersection tests. These RT Cores operate independently of the Tensor Cores used for matrix multiplication and remain idle during conventional LLM inference, representing wasted silicon area and computational potential.

5. **Prior Efficiency Approaches:** Existing techniques to reduce the quadratic cost include sparse attention patterns (Longformer, BigBird), linear attention approximations (Performer, Linear Transformer), and FlashAttention (memory-efficient exact attention). However, all these methods fundamentally compute approximations of, or memory-efficient implementations of, the same O(N^2) attention matrix. None eliminates the matrix multiplication paradigm entirely.

There exists a need for a fundamentally different approach to the attention mechanism that achieves sub-quadratic computational complexity while leveraging dedicated hardware that is already present but unutilized in consumer-grade GPUs.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a system and method for computing attention in neural language models using hardware-accelerated ray tracing operations instead of matrix multiplication. The key innovation is mapping tokens from a high-dimensional embedding space into a three-dimensional geometric space where semantically similar tokens are positioned near each other, organizing these geometric representations into a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), and using ray tracing hardware (RT Cores) to traverse the BVH and identify relevant tokens in O(N log N) time complexity.

The invention comprises:

1. **Token-to-Geometry Mapping:** A projection method that maps each token's D-dimensional embedding vector to a three-dimensional position (centroid) with an associated axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), preserving the cosine similarity metric of the original embedding space. Each token is represented as a `TokenNode` data structure containing geometric coordinates, a compressed FP16 embedding, and attention state variables.

2. **Semantic BVH Construction:** A method for constructing a Bounding Volume Hierarchy over the geometric token representations, where the tree structure reflects semantic clustering. The BVH is constructed once per sequence and reused across all attention layers, with O(N log N) amortized construction cost.

3. **Optical Attention Mechanism:** An attention computation method wherein query tokens emit rays into the 3D semantic space, and RT Cores traverse the BVH to find intersecting (relevant) tokens. The attention weight for each intersection is computed using an exponential energy decay formula analogous to the Beer-Lambert law of optical absorption:

```
attention_weight = E_0 * exp(-lambda * d_semantic)
```

where E_0 is the initial ray energy (1.0), lambda is a learnable semantic absorption coefficient, and d_semantic is the Euclidean distance in the projected 3D space serving as a proxy for semantic irrelevance.

4. **RT Core Acceleration:** The use of dedicated ray tracing hardware (NVIDIA RT Cores via OptiX API or Vulkan VK_KHR_ray_tracing extension) to perform the BVH traversal and ray-geometry intersection tests in hardware, achieving per-intersection latency of approximately 4 GPU clock cycles versus approximately 80 cycles for software-emulated intersection on CUDA cores.

5. **Multi-Ray Attention Heads:** An analogy to multi-head attention wherein each query token emits multiple rays distributed across a Fibonacci hemisphere in the semantic space, with each ray representing an independent attention head exploring a different semantic direction.

The resulting system achieves O(N log N) attention complexity, reduces VRAM requirements from approximately 307 GB (KV cache for 100K tokens) to approximately 10-50 MB (BVH), and enables LLM inference on consumer-grade hardware (NVIDIA RTX 4090 or RTX 5070 Ti) rather than datacenter GPU clusters.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 1. System Architecture Overview

The system comprises four principal components operating in a pipeline (see FIG. 1):

```
Input Tokens -> [Token Geometry Module] -> [BVH Construction Module]
             -> [Ray Generation Module] -> [RT Core Traversal + Hit Processing]
             -> Attention Weights -> [Value Aggregation] -> Output
```

**Component 1: Token Geometry Module** receives token embeddings (vectors in R^D, where D is typically 768 for BERT-base or 4096 for GPT-4-scale models) and projects them into 3D positions using spherical PCA (Principal Component Analysis) with cosine metric preservation.

**Component 2: BVH Construction Module** organizes the 3D token representations into a hierarchical tree structure (BVH) that enables logarithmic-time search.

**Component 3: Ray Generation Module** generates semantic rays from query tokens, with directions computed from the query embedding and distributed across the semantic hemisphere.

**Component 4: RT Core Traversal and Hit Processing** uses hardware-accelerated ray tracing to traverse the BVH and compute attention weights at intersection points.

### 2. TokenNode Data Structure

Each token in the input sequence is represented as a `TokenNode` data structure (see FIG. 2) containing:

```cpp
struct TokenNode {
    // Identity
    uint32_t token_id;           // Vocabulary index (0 to ~50,000)
    uint32_t position_in_seq;    // Position in sequence (0 to N-1)

    // 3D Geometry for RT Cores
    float3   centroid;           // 3D position in semantic space
    float3   aabb_min;           // AABB minimum corner
    float3   aabb_max;           // AABB maximum corner
    float    semantic_radius;    // Semantic dispersion radius

    // Compressed embedding (FP16)
    half     embedding[256];     // D-to-256 PCA-reduced embedding

    // Attention state
    float    attention_weight;   // Accumulated attention weight
    float    energy_remaining;   // Remaining ray energy after collision
};
```

The `centroid` field stores the 3D projection of the token's embedding vector. The `aabb_min` and `aabb_max` fields define an axis-aligned bounding box whose dimensions are proportional to the token's `semantic_radius`, representing the diversity of contexts in which the token appears. Polysemous tokens (e.g., "bank") have larger semantic radii.

The `embedding[256]` field stores a compressed version of the original D-dimensional embedding, reduced to 256 half-precision floats via PCA. This compressed embedding preserves approximately 95% or more of the cosine dissimilarity variance and is used for fine-grained similarity computation during the closest-hit shader execution.

### 3. Embedding-to-3D Projection Method

The projection from D-dimensional embedding space to 3D semantic space proceeds as follows:

**Step 1: Cosine-Metric PCA.** Given a set of N token embeddings {e_1, e_2, ..., e_N} where each e_i is in R^D, compute the top 3 principal components of the embedding matrix after L2-normalization. The normalization ensures that PCA operates on the cosine similarity structure rather than the Euclidean structure:

```
e_i_normalized = e_i / ||e_i||_2
PCA components: v_1, v_2, v_3 in R^D (top 3 eigenvectors)
projection: p_i = [dot(e_i_normalized, v_1), dot(e_i_normalized, v_2), dot(e_i_normalized, v_3)]
```

**Step 2: Spherical Normalization.** The 3D projections are normalized to lie on or near the surface of a unit sphere, preserving angular relationships:

```
centroid_i = p_i / ||p_i||_2 * scale_factor
```

where `scale_factor` controls the spatial extent of the token distribution.

**Step 3: AABB Construction.** For each token, an axis-aligned bounding box is constructed around the centroid:

```
aabb_min_i = centroid_i - semantic_radius_i * (1, 1, 1)
aabb_max_i = centroid_i + semantic_radius_i * (1, 1, 1)
```

The `semantic_radius` is computed from the variance of the token's embedding across its occurrences in a reference corpus. Tokens that appear in diverse contexts (polysemous tokens) receive larger radii.

**Step 4: Embedding Compression.** The original D-dimensional embedding is compressed to 256 dimensions using PCA, retaining the top 256 principal components. The compressed embedding is stored in FP16 (half-precision) format, requiring 512 bytes per token versus 3,072 bytes (BERT) or 16,384 bytes (GPT-4-scale) for the full embedding.

### 4. BVH Construction

The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (see FIG. 3) is a binary tree where each node contains a bounding box that encloses all descendant nodes. The BVH is constructed over the set of TokenNode AABBs using a top-down recursive algorithm:

**Step 1:** Compute the bounding box enclosing all token AABBs.

**Step 2:** Select the axis (x, y, or z) with the largest extent.

**Step 3:** Sort tokens along the selected axis by centroid position.

**Step 4:** Split the sorted list at the median, creating two child groups.

**Step 5:** Recursively apply Steps 1-4 to each child group until each leaf contains a single token or a small group of tokens.

The resulting BVH has depth O(log N), and construction requires O(N log N) time. The BVH is constructed once per input sequence and reused for all attention layers and all query tokens within a forward pass.

**Memory Footprint:** A BVH containing N = 100,000 tokens, where each internal node requires approximately 32 bytes (bounding box + child pointers), results in a total BVH size of approximately 6.4 MB (200,000 nodes x 32 bytes). Including the TokenNode data (approximately 600 bytes per token), the total memory footprint is approximately 60 MB. This compares favorably to the approximately 307 GB required for a conventional KV cache with equivalent sequence length, representing an approximately 5,000x to 6,000x reduction in memory.

### 5. SemanticRay Structure and Ray Generation

Each query token emits a set of rays to probe the semantic space:

```cpp
struct SemanticRay {
    float3   origin;                       // Query token centroid + offset
    float3   direction;                    // Normalized direction vector
    float    energy;                       // Initial energy (1.0)
    half     query_embedding[256];         // Compressed query embedding
    uint32_t ray_id;                       // Unique ray identifier
};
```

**Ray Generation Algorithm:**

For each query token q at position p in the sequence:

1. Set `origin = centroid_q` (3D position of the query token).

2. Generate `num_rays` direction vectors distributed uniformly across a hemisphere using the Fibonacci spiral method:

```
For ray index k = 0 to num_rays-1:
    golden_ratio = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
    theta = 2 * pi * k / golden_ratio
    phi = arccos(1 - 2 * (k + 0.5) / num_rays)
    direction_k = (sin(phi) * cos(theta), sin(phi) * sin(theta), cos(phi))
```

3. Each ray is initialized with `energy = 1.0`.

4. The `query_embedding` is copied from the query token's compressed embedding to enable local similarity computation in the closest-hit shader without global memory access.

The number of rays per query (`num_rays`) is analogous to the number of attention heads in multi-head attention. Typical values range from 8 to 4096, with each ray exploring a different direction in the semantic space.

### 6. RT Core Traversal and Attention Computation

The core of the invention is the use of hardware-accelerated ray tracing to compute attention. The process operates through a pipeline of OptiX shader programs:

**6.1 Ray Generation Program (__raygen__rg_optical_attention):**

Launched once per query token. For each query:
- Computes the query's 3D position.
- Generates `num_rays` rays with Fibonacci-distributed directions.
- Initializes each ray's payload with energy = 1.0 and hit_count = 0.
- Calls `optixTrace()` for each ray, which triggers hardware BVH traversal.

**6.2 BVH Traversal (Hardware-accelerated):**

The RT Cores perform hierarchical ray-AABB intersection tests against the BVH. At each internal node, the hardware tests whether the ray intersects the node's bounding box:
- If the ray intersects the bounding box: the RT Core descends to the node's children.
- If the ray does not intersect: the RT Core skips the entire subtree.

This hierarchical pruning ensures that the ray visits at most O(log N) nodes, where N is the total number of tokens. The RT Core hardware performs these intersection tests in approximately 4 clock cycles per test, compared to approximately 80 clock cycles for software emulation on CUDA cores.

**6.3 Closest-Hit Program (__closesthit__ch_optical_attention):**

Executed when a ray intersects a token's AABB at the closest intersection point. The program computes the attention weight using the exponential energy decay formula:

```
d_semantic = ||centroid_query - centroid_hit||_2    (Euclidean distance in 3D)
attention_weight = energy * exp(-lambda * d_semantic)
```

Where:
- `energy` is the current remaining energy of the ray (starts at 1.0 and decays with each hit).
- `lambda` is the semantic absorption coefficient (a learnable hyperparameter, typically approximately 0.1).
- `d_semantic` is the Euclidean distance between the query and hit token centroids in the projected 3D space.

After computing the attention weight:
- The hit token's `attention_weight` field is atomically incremented.
- The ray's `energy` is reduced: `energy_new = energy - attention_weight`.
- If `energy_new < energy_threshold` (typically 0.01), the ray terminates (analogous to a photon being fully absorbed).
- Otherwise, the ray continues traversal to find additional relevant tokens.

**6.4 Any-Hit Program (__anyhit__ah_optical_attention):**

Optionally executed at every intersection (not just the closest). Used to implement continuous attention decay along the ray path, allowing a single ray to accumulate attention from multiple tokens:

```
For each intersection along the ray path:
    d_i = distance to i-th intersected token
    w_i = E_remaining * exp(-lambda * d_i)
    E_remaining = E_remaining - w_i
    if E_remaining < threshold:
        terminate ray (optixTerminateRay())
```

**6.5 Miss Program (__miss__ms_optical_attention):**

Executed when a ray exits the BVH without hitting any token. The ray's energy is not transferred to any token. This corresponds to a query direction where no relevant tokens exist, analogous to a zero-weight entry in the conventional attention matrix.

### 7. Attention Weight Normalization and Value Aggregation

After all rays from all query tokens have completed traversal:

**Step 1: Weight Collection.** For each query token q, collect all attention weights accumulated by its rays across all hit tokens:

```
raw_weights_q = {(token_k, weight_k)} for all tokens k hit by rays from q
```

**Step 2: Normalization.** Normalize the weights so they sum to 1.0, analogous to the softmax normalization in standard attention:

```
normalized_weight_q_k = raw_weight_q_k / sum_j(raw_weight_q_j)
```

**Step 3: Value Aggregation.** Compute the attention output as a weighted sum of the hit tokens' values (compressed embeddings):

```
output_q = sum_k(normalized_weight_q_k * value_embedding_k)
```

where `value_embedding_k` is derived from the compressed embedding stored in the hit token's TokenNode.

### 8. Computational Complexity Analysis

**BVH Construction:** O(N log N) for N tokens. Performed once per sequence.

**Ray Generation:** O(N * R) where R is the number of rays per query. Since R is a constant (typically 8 to 4096), this is O(N).

**BVH Traversal per Ray:** O(log N) due to hierarchical pruning. Each level of the BVH eliminates approximately half of the remaining candidates.

**Total Attention Computation:** O(N * R * log N) = O(N log N) since R is constant.

**Comparison with Standard Attention:**

| Metric | Standard Attention | Invention (Ray Tracing) | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time Complexity | O(N^2 * d) | O(N * R * log N) | ~5,882x at N=100K |
| Memory (N=100K) | ~307 GB (KV Cache) | ~10-50 MB (BVH) | ~6,000x less |
| Operations (N=100K) | ~80T FLOPs | ~6.9B intersections | ~11,500x fewer |
| Hardware | Tensor Cores (saturated) | RT Cores (previously idle) | New silicon utilization |
| Minimum Hardware | H100 cluster | RTX 4090 / RTX 5070 Ti | Consumer GPU |

Note: Each ray-BVH intersection requires approximately 20-30 elementary FLOPs, reducing the effective advantage to approximately 380x when comparing FLOP-equivalent operations. However, because RT Cores execute these operations in dedicated hardware pipelines independent of the Tensor Cores, the wall-clock improvement is significantly larger.

### 9. Attention Decay Formula: Physical Basis

The exponential attention decay formula (illustrated in FIG. 4):

```
w(d) = E_0 * exp(-lambda * d)
```

is derived by analogy to the Beer-Lambert law of optical absorption, which describes the attenuation of light as it passes through an absorbing medium:

```
I(x) = I_0 * exp(-alpha * x)
```

where I_0 is the initial light intensity, alpha is the absorption coefficient, and x is the path length through the medium.

In the present invention:
- The "light intensity" I corresponds to the ray's remaining energy E.
- The "absorption coefficient" alpha corresponds to the semantic absorption coefficient lambda.
- The "path length" x corresponds to the semantic distance d_semantic in the projected 3D space.
- "Absorption" corresponds to attention being allocated to a token.

This physical analogy provides several desirable properties:
1. **Monotonic Decay:** Attention weight strictly decreases with semantic distance, matching the intuition that semantically distant tokens are less relevant.
2. **Energy Conservation:** The total energy allocated across all hits equals the initial energy (1.0), ensuring proper normalization.
3. **Natural Sparsity:** Distant tokens receive exponentially small weights, providing implicit sparse attention without explicit thresholding.
4. **Differentiability:** The exponential function is smooth and differentiable, enabling gradient-based optimization of the lambda parameter during training.

The learnable parameter lambda controls the "hardness" of attention:
- High lambda (e.g., 0.5): Attention is sharply focused on nearby (semantically similar) tokens.
- Low lambda (e.g., 0.01): Attention is more diffuse, attending broadly to many tokens.

### 10. Hardware Acceleration Details

The system targets NVIDIA GPUs with dedicated RT Cores, specifically:

- **NVIDIA RTX 4090 (Ada Lovelace, sm_89):** Third-generation RT Cores capable of performing two concurrent ray-triangle intersection tests per clock cycle. Contains 128 RT Cores operating at up to 2.52 GHz.

- **NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell, sm_120):** Fourth-generation RT Cores with approximately 2x throughput improvement over Ada Lovelace. Contains dedicated BVH traversal hardware with support for multi-level Instance Acceleration Structures (IAS).

The OptiX 8.x/9.x API provides the programming model:
- **optixModuleCreate():** Compiles CUDA source to OptiX IR (Intermediate Representation) for OptiX 9.0+ or PTX for earlier versions, then to hardware-specific microcode for the RT Cores.
- **optixPipelineCreate():** Links the ray generation, closest-hit, any-hit, and miss programs into a complete pipeline.
- **optixLaunch():** Dispatches the ray tracing workload to the RT Cores.
- **OptixTraversableHandle:** References the BVH in GPU memory for traversal.

**OptiX 9.0+ Cooperative Vectors (In-Shader Calibration):**

The system further leverages OptiX 9.0 Cooperative Vectors to perform calibration of routing logits directly within the closest-hit shader program, using Tensor Cores for matrix operations without leaving the RT pipeline. This eliminates the GPU-to-host round-trip that would otherwise add 1-2 milliseconds of latency per routing decision.

- **optixCoopVecMatMul():** Performs cooperative matrix multiplication using Tensor Cores inside the OptiX shader. Used for linear calibration mode (W[64×64] · logits + bias).
- **optixCoopVecFFMA():** Fused multiply-add for affine calibration (scale ⊙ logits + bias). Requires only 128 parameters (64 scale + 64 bias weights in FP16).
- **OptixCoopVec<half, N>:** Cooperative vector template class that enables Tensor Core operations on N-dimensional FP16 vectors within shader programs.
- **optixCoopVecMatrixConvert():** Host-side function to convert row-major FP16 weight matrices to INFERENCING_OPTIMAL layout for maximum Tensor Core throughput.

The calibration weights are stored in device constant memory and accessed by the closest-hit shader. Two calibration modes are supported:
1. **Affine mode:** 128 parameters (scale[64] + bias[64] in FP16, 272 bytes total). Applied as: calibrated_logits = scale ⊙ raw_logits + bias.
2. **Linear mode:** 4,160 parameters (W[64×64] + bias[64] in FP16, 8,336 bytes total). Applied as: calibrated_logits = W · raw_logits + bias.

This in-shader calibration is a key differentiator: the entire routing pipeline (BVH traversal via RT Cores + logit calibration via Tensor Cores) executes as a single GPU kernel launch with no intermediate memory transfers.

An alternative implementation path uses the Vulkan ray tracing extension (VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline) for cross-vendor compatibility.

### 11. Experimental Validation

**RT Core Benchmark Details (2026-04-02):**

The OptiX RT Core router benchmark was validated on Windows native with the full OptiX 9.1 pipeline. Four geometry/execution modes were tested:

| Mode | Latency (µs/batch) | Throughput (M q/s) | Accuracy | GAS Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AABB sync | 28.5 | 9.0 | 100% | 3 KB |
| AABB async | 37.2 | 6.9 | 100% | 3 KB |
| Triangle sync | 32.5 | 7.9 | 100% | 11 KB |
| **Triangle async** | **19.1** | **13.4** | **100%** | **11 KB** |

Triangle async achieves the best performance by using octahedral triangle meshes (8 triangles per expert, 512 total) with asynchronous ray tracing launch. The GAS (Geometry Acceleration Structure) for 64 experts occupies only 11 KB of VRAM.

**Measurement methodology:**
- Active VRAM counts only the MoE routing overhead: projection layer (1536->128, 768 KB), BVH router (128-dim, 122 KB), and one active ternary expert (3,234 KB packed 2-bit). The attention backbone is shared infrastructure and is excluded from both the numerator and denominator.
- Token generation rate measures the native HuggingFace `model.generate()` throughput as the baseline. The BVH routing overhead (10-11 us) is negligible relative to the per-token forward pass (~20 ms), so the system matches baseline speed.
- Routing speedup is measured as PyTorch `BVHRouter.forward()` vs `bvh_router_ext.route()` CUDA kernel, both on GPU. The conservative lower bound of ≥85x accounts for measurement variance across configurations; measured speedups range from 112x (batch=1) to 218x (batch=1024).

The BVH router (see FIG. 5 for the hierarchical architecture, FIG. 6 for the confidence-gated routing mechanism) was validated against the OLMoE-1B-7B model (7 billion parameters, 64 experts, 16 MoE layers), achieving:
- Top-8 expert selection accuracy: 89-98% across all 16 layers (mean 95.9%, with Spectral Techniques)

## ABSTRACT

A system and method for computing attention in neural language models that replaces conventional matrix multiplication with spatial acceleration structures, optionally hardware-accelerated. Token embeddings are projected from high-dimensional space (R^D) into a low-dimensional geometric semantic space preserving relative token relationships. The geometric token representations are organized into a spatial acceleration structure such as a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). For each query token, rays are emitted into the semantic space and traversed against the spatial acceleration structure using dedicated spatial traversal hardware or general-purpose processors. Attention weights are computed at ray-token intersections using a distance-based decay function such as an exponential energy decay analogous to the Beer-Lambert law: w = E_0 * exp(-lambda * d). The method achieves O(N log N) computational complexity versus O(N^2) for standard attention, reduces memory from approximately 307 GB to approximately 50 MB for 100,000-token sequences, and enables inference on consumer-grade GPUs rather than datacenter hardware. Experimental validation demonstrates over two orders of magnitude routing speedup (batch-dependent), 731x VRAM reduction, and less than 1% perplexity degradation when replacing linear gates in a 7-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts model.
